# Sample gradle project showing Idea generic related 

In some cases when kotlin classes are used as dependency in Java classes those points are in Idea marked with
```reason: no instance(s) of type variable(s) exist so that Data conforms to Data```, but code is possible to compile and run.
Also, same code used in same gradle project does not raise any generic related issue.
